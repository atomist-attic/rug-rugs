Feature: Ready Rug Project for TypeScript
  The AddTypeScript editor should add TypeScript supporting files to a
  Rug project


  Scenario: AddTypeScript should add support files for writing Rugs in TypeScript
    Given a Rug archive manifest
    When edit with AddTypeScript
    Then there should be a package file
    Then the package file depends on rugs
    Then there should be a tsconfig file
    Then the tsconfig file should have standard contents
    Then the node modules directory should not exist
    Then the rug interfaces should not exist


  Scenario: AddTypeScript should not make changes if the target project is not a Rug archive
    Given an empty project
    When edit with AddTypeScript
    Then no changes were made
