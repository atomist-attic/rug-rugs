Feature: Automatically add path expression to a Rug
  People have difficulty remembering what needs to be imported and
  how to instantiate an instance of the path expression engine.
  Automate it in an editor.


  Scenario: HavePathExpressionEngine puts a path expression in the typescript
    Given a Rug archive manifest
    Given a Rug archive package.json
    Given a TypeScript editor
    When HavePathExpressionEngine is run on TypeScriptEditor
    Then parameters were valid
    Then changes were made
    Then TypeScriptEditor has a path expression const
    Then TypeScriptEditor has the path expression imports
