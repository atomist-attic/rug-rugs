Feature: Bring a Rug project up to the latest versions and conventions
  We should be able to update a Rug project files to use
  the latest version of rug and @atomist/rugs as well as
  the latest TypeScript and build configuration.


  Scenario: UpdateRug should safely update Rug dependencies and support files
    Given a Rug archive package.json
    When UpdateRug is run
    Then parameters were valid
    Then changes were made
    Then file at .atomist/package.json should exist
    Then the package file depends on the current versions of rug dependencies
    Then file at .atomist/package.json should contain "name": "@joe-henry/scar"
    Then file at .atomist/package.json should contain "version": "2001.5.15"
    Then file at .atomist/package.json should contain "mocha": "^3.2.0"
    Then file at .atomist/package.json should contain devDependencies
    Then file at .atomist/package.json should contain "autotest":
    Then file at .atomist/package.json should contain "lint": "tslint '**/*.ts' --exclude 'node_modules/**' --exclude 'target/**' -t verbose",
    Then file at .atomist/.gitignore should exist
    Then file at .atomist/tsconfig.json should exist
    Then file at .atomist/tslint.json should exist
    Then file at .atomist/build/travis-build.bash should exist
    Then file at .atomist/build/cli.yml should exist


  Scenario: UpdateRug should abort if project is not a Rug project
    Given an empty project
    When UpdateRug is run
    Then the scenario aborted
