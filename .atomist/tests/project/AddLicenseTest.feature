    Then changes were made
    Then the project has new LICENSE
    Then the src/hello1.ts file has license
    Then the src/subdir/hello2.ts file has license
    Then the src/hello3.txt file does not have license
    Then the hello1.ts file has previous code
    Then the test/hello4.ts file has license
    Then the other/hello4.ts file does not have license
