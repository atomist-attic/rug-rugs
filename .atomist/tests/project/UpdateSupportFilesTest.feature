    When edit with UpdateSupportFiles
    Then parameters were valid
    Then changes were made
    Then file at .atomist/package.json should exist

    Then file at .atomist/tsconfig.json should exist
    Then file at .atomist/tsconfig.json should contain suppressImplicitAnyIndexErrors

    Then the scenario aborted


  Scenario: UpdateSupportFiles should safely update gitattributes
    Given a Rug archive package.json
    Given a Travis CI config
